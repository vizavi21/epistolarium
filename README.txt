 This piece of code takes a chunk of data and creates checkboxes based on properties on the data.  I then use the AngularJS filter to loop through the data and include the products that have the checked properties.   The solution I found for checkboxes in Angular is to add an "IsIncluded" property to each checkbox to check the state.  I recently added Angular Material just for fun.
